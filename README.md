### **Employee & Task Management System**

This is a robust, client-side **Employee and Task Management System** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

* **Admin Dashboard:** An exclusive dashboard for the administrator to assign, manage, and view tasks for all employees.
* **Employee Profiles:** Each employee has a unique profile where they can view only the tasks assigned to them.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface built with **Tailwind CSS**.
