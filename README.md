### **Employee & Task Management System**

This is a robust, client-side **Employee and Task Management System** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides an administrative panel to assign tasks to employees and allows each employee to view their assigned tasks on their individual profile. All user authentication and task data are securely handled in the browser's **Local Storage**, providing a complete solution without the need for a backend.

### **Key Features**

* **Secure Client-Side Authentication:** Six predefined user accounts (email and password) are securely stored in Local Storage for authentication.
* **Admin Dashboard:** An exclusive dashboard for the administrator to assign, manage, and view tasks for all employees.
* **Employee Profiles:** Each employee has a unique profile where they can view only the tasks assigned to them.
* **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface built with **Tailwind CSS**.
